Configuration Class

- a class that helps keep the information necessary for the parser

Fields:
    - state: the dictionary containing the valid states
    - state["q"]: the normal state, if everything goes as it should
    - state["f"]: the success state, if the end has been reached
    - state["b"]: the back state, if a wrong path has been chosen
    - state["e"]: the error state, if success cannot be reached
    - index: the index of the parsing element
    - work_stack: the stack that is being built by analyzing elements
    - input_stack: the stack that dictates the next analyzed element


Parser

Fields:
    - grammar: the grammar of the language
    - configuration : the configuration class used in helping the parsing

Methods:
    - expand: if at the top of the stack there is a nonterminal, this operation places it in the work stack, replacing it in the input stack with the first production
    - advance: if at the top of the stack there is a valid terminal for the given sequence, it is pushed from the input stack to the work stack and the index is incremented
    - momentary_insuccess: if at the top of the stack there is a valid terminal for the given sequence, it enters the back state
    - another_try: when in the back state and at the top of the input stack there is a nonterminal, this operation brings it back to the normal one and replaces the nonterminal with its next valid production
    - back: when in the back state and at the top of the input stack there is a terminal, this operation brings it back to the normal one and brings the terminals back in the input stack, while the index is decremented
    - success: the input stack is empty and the work stack contains the given sequence
    - run: the function for the parsing algorithm
