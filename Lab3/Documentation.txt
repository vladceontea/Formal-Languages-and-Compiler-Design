Scanner

Fields:
    - symbol_table: The symbol table used to store the constants and identifiers, represented as a hash table
    - pif_table: The PIF table used to store all the tokens found in the code, represented as a list of tuples with the value and the symbol table position
    - token_list: The list of specials tokens in the language
    - separator_list: The list of written separators and operators in the language, which can be written next to other elements
    - file: The file that is scanned

Methods:
    - read_tokens: reads all the special tokens in the language
    - read_word_separators: reads the written separators and operators in the language
    - is_identifier: checks if the word is a valid identifier
    - is_constant: checks if the word is a valid constant
    - scan: the actual scanning function, which creates the symbol table and pif table based on the read file; it checks every word in the source code and decides whether it is a valid token or not, in which case it prints a message and the line
