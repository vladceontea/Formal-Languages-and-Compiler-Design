Finite Automata

Fields:
    - set_of_states: the set of states that appear in the FA
    - alphabet: the alphabet that
    - transition: all the transitions that appear in the FA
    - initial_state: the initial state of the FA at the start
    - set_of_final_states: the possible final states of the FA at the end
    - file: the name of the file that contains the rules of the FA

Methods:
    - print_set_of_states: prints the list of set of states
    - print_alphabet: prints the alphabet
    - print_initial_state: prints the initial state
    - print_set_of_final_states: prints the set of final states
    - print_transitions: prints all the transitions in the "(q,a)->p" format
    - check_dfa: checks if the FA is a DFA, that is from a state one transition only leads to one other state
    - check_sequence: checks if the given sequence is accepted by the FA, so it can be formed by a certain sequence of transitions starting from the initial one and ending in one of the final ones
    - read_fa: reads the details of the FA from the given file in the order: set of states, alphabet, initial state, set of final states, transitions

Format of FA.in file:
